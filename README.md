# Superstore_Sales_Analysis
Project Title: Superstore Sales Analysis

Description:

In this data analysis project, I explored and analyzed the Superstore Sales dataset using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The Superstore Sales dataset is a fictional retail dataset containing information about orders, customers, products, and sales.

Key Highlights:

Data Cleaning: I began by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas, I performed EDA to gain insights into the dataset's structure and distribution. I visualized trends and patterns in sales, profits, and customer behavior.
Data Visualization: Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created a variety of charts and graphs to present the findings effectively. This included bar plots, scatter plots, and time series visualizations.
Insights: Through this analysis, I identified key trends in sales revenue, profit margins, product categories, and customer segments.
Recommendations: Based on the insights gained, I proposed actionable recommendations to improve business performance, customer targeting, and product offerings.
